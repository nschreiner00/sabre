	        <p>This is the home page for the South Hills Napping Society. We are a group of peole who take our napping very seriously. We believe that including naps in your daily routine can improve your quality of life, as well as providing fun through dreams!</p>
            <h3>Real facts on napping.<p2> From the sleep foundation.</p2> </h3>
            
          <p>More than 85% of mammalian species are polyphasic sleepers, meaning that they sleep for short periods throughout the day. Humans are part of the minority of monophasic sleepers, meaning that our days are divided into two distinct periods, one for sleep and one for wakefulness. It is not clear that this is the natural sleep pattern of humans. Young children and elderly persons nap, for example, and napping is a very important aspect of many cultures.</p>
          <p>To the right of this page are different types of naps. As a group, we generally focus on the third of these, but we are a very support group of friends who will help with any type of naps.</p></td>
	      <td width="51%" valign="top"><h3>Types:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Planned napping </strong>(also called preparatory napping) involves taking a nap before you actually get sleepy. You may use this technique when you know that you will be up later than your normal bed time or as a mechanism to ward off getting tired earlier.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Emergency napping </strong>occurs when you are suddenly very tired and cannot continue with the activity you were originally engaged in. This type of nap can be used to combat drowsy driving or fatigue while using heavy and dangerous machinery.</li>
              <li><strong>Habitual napping </strong>is practiced when a person takes a nap at the same time each day. Young children may fall asleep at about the same time each afternoon or an adult might take a short nap after lunch each day.              </li>
