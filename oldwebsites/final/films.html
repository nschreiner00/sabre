      <h2>Die Hard</h2>
      <p>Die Hard is a 1988 American action film directed by John McTiernan and written by Steven E. de Souza and Jeb Stuart. It is based on the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, by Roderick Thorp. Die Hard follows off-duty New York City Police Department officer John McClane (Bruce Willis) as he takes on a group of highly organized criminals led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), who perform a heist in a Los Angeles skyscraper under the guise of a terrorist attack using hostages, including McClane's wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), to keep the police at bay.</p>
      <p>Made on a $28 million budget, Die Hard went on to gross over $140 million theatrically worldwide, and received a positive reception from critics. The film turned Willis into an action star, became a frequent comparison for other action films featuring a lone hero fighting overwhelming odds, and is now widely considered one of the greatest action movies ever made. The film's success spawned the Die Hard franchise, which includes four sequels, video games, and a comic book.</p>

      <h2>Predator</h2>
      <p>In 1987, Delta Force Major Alan &quot;Dutch&quot; Schaefer and his six-man team, consisting of himself, operators Mac Eliot and Billy Sole, Blain Cooper, ordnance expert Poncho Ramirez and radioman Rick Hawkins, are tasked by the CIA with spearheading the rescue of an official held hostage by insurgents in Val Verde. Agent George Dillon, an old friend of Schaefer's, is assigned to supervise. The team is inserted into a remote jungle and begins the mission.</p>
      <p>They soon discover the wreckage of another chopper and several skinned corpses, whom Schaefer identifies as U.S Army Special Forces he once trained. Pressing on, the team reaches the insurgent camp and clears it of troops, including a Soviet intelligence officer searching through top-secret CIA documents. Dillon, confronted by a suspicious Schaefer, admits the mission was a setup to retrieve intelligence from captured operatives and that the dead unit disappeared weeks earlier in a failed rescue. Accompanied by a surviving hostage named Anna, the group proceeds to extraction point, unaware that they are being observed by an invisible entity using thermal imaging.</p>
