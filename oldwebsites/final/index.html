      <h4>Biography:</h4>
    <p>I do not remember much of my life from before the accident, so my biography will have to start there.</p>
    <p>It was starting to end, after what seemed most of eternity to me.</p>
    <p>I attempted to wriggle my toes, succeeded. I was sprawled there in a hospital bed and my legs were done up in plaster casts, but they were still mine. I squeezed my eyes shut, and opened them, three times. The room grew steady. Where was I?</p>
    <p>Then the fogs were slowly broken, and some of that which is called memory returned to me. I recalled nights and nurses and needles. Every time things would begin to clear a bit, someone would come in and jab me with something. That's how it had been. Yes. Now, though, I was feeling halfway decent. They'd have to stop. Wouldn't they?</p>
    <p>The thought came to assail me:<em> Maybe not.</em></p>
    <p>Some natural skepticism as to the purity of all human motives came and sat upon my chest. I'd been over-narcotized, I suddently knew. No real reason for it, from the way I felt, and no reason for them to stop now, if they'd been paid to keep it up. So play cool and stay dopey, said a voice which was my worst, if wiser, self. So I did.</p>
    <p>A nurse poked her head in the door about ten minutes later, and I was, of course, still stacking Z's. She went away. By then, I reconstructed a bit of what had occurred. I had been in some sort of accident, I remembered vaguely. What had happened after that was still a blur; and as to what had happened before, I had no inkling whatsoever. But I had first been in a hospital and then brought to this place, I remembered. Why? I didn't know.</p>
    <p>However, my legs felt pretty good. Good enough to hold me up, though I didn't know how much time had lapsed since their breaking--and I knew they'd been broken.</p>
    <p>So I sat up. It took me a real effort, as my muscles were very tired. It was dark outside and a haldful of stars were standing naked beyond the window. I winked back at them and threw my legs over the edge of the bed. I was dizzy, but after a while it subsided and I got up, gripping the rail at the head of the bed, and I took my first step.</p>
    <p>Okay. My legs held me. So, theoretically, I was in good enough shape to walk out.</p>
    <p>I made it back to bed, strectched out and though. I was sweating and shaking. Visions of sugar plums, etc. So I lay there and mulled. It seemed I was in some sort of private place--so somebody was footing the bill. Whom did I know? No visions of relatives appeared behind me eyes. Friends either. What did that leave? Enemies?</p>
    <p>I thought a while. Nothing. Nobody to benefact me thus.</p>
    <p>I'd gone over a cliff in my car, and into a lake, I suddenly remembered. And that was all I remembered.</p>
    <p>I was... I strained and began to sweat again.</p>
    <p>I didn't know <em><a href="plot_twist.html">who</a></em> I was.</p>
