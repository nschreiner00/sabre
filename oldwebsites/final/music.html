      <h2>Lady Lamb the Beekeeper</h2>
      <p>Aly Spaltro, better known by her stage name Lady Lamb (formerly called Lady Lamb the Beekeeper) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. Spaltro first began writing music in 2007 in Bart &amp; Greg's DVD Explosion, the local video rental store in her hometown of Brunswick, Maine, United States. Spaltro worked the closing shift, and would experiment with and record music all night into the morning. These early years (2007-2010) had a huge effect on her sound stylistically, creating a basis for her future recordings.</p>
      <p>The first Lady Lamb recordings were home recordings distributed in handmade packages to the local Bullmoose Record Store in Brunswick, Maine. In 2010, Spaltro moved to Brooklyn, New York. In 2012, Spaltro met producer Nadim Issa and recorded her debut studio record, Ripely Pine at Let Em In Music in Gowanus, Brooklyn. It was released February 19, 2013 on Brooklyn's Ba Da Bing Records.</p>
      <p>In 2014, Spaltro recorded and co-produced her sophomore studio album, After, with Nadim Issa at Let Em In Music. Late that same year, Spaltro signed with Mom + Pop Music and released After on March 3, 2015.</p>
      <p>The song I have featured is off of the new album After.</p>

      <h2>Beethoven</h2>
      <p>Ludwig van Beethoven (baptised 17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. A crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras in Western art music, he remains one of the most famous and influential of all composers. His best-known compositions include 9 symphonies, 5 concertos for piano, 1 violin concerto, 32 piano sonatas, and 16 string quartets. He also composed other chamber music, choral works (including the celebrated Missa solemnis), and songs.</p>
      <p>Born in Bonn, then the capital of the Electorate of Cologne and part of the Holy Roman Empire, Beethoven displayed his musical talents at an early age and was taught by his father Johann van Beethoven and by Christian Gottlob Neefe. </p>
      <p>The piece I have featured is Piano Sonata No. 29 in B-flat major, first movement, Op. 106 (known as the Große Sonate für das Hammerklavier, or more simply as the Hammerklavier) is a piano sonata widely considered to be one of the most important works of the composer's third period and among the greatest piano sonatas. It is often considered to be Beethoven's technically most challenging piano composition and one of the most challenging solo works in the classical piano repertoire. It is played here by the lovely Valentina Lisitsa.</p>
