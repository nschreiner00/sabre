      <h2>Gekkan Shōjo Nozaki-kun</h2>
      <p>High school student Chiyo Sakura has a crush on schoolmate Umetarō Nozaki, but when she confesses her love to him, he mistakes her for a fan and gives her an autograph. When she says that she always wants to be with him, he invites her to his house and has her help on some drawings. Chiyo discovers that Nozaki is actually a renowned shōjo manga artist named Sakiko Yumeno. She then agrees to be his assistant in order to get closer to him. As they work on his manga Let's Fall in Love, they encounter other schoolmates who assist them or serve as inspirations for characters in the stories.</p>
      <p>The title character of the series, high school student Umetarō Nozaki, is the object of Sakura's affection. He is secretly a manga artist named Sakiko Yumeno , creator of the shōjo manga Let's Fall in Love which is published in the magazine Monthly Girls' Romance. Despite making a romance-oriented manga, he has no personal experience in love (as such, his story ideas are often ridiculous and farfetched). He appreciates Sakura's drawing ability but is oblivious to her feelings.</p>
      <p>The viewpoint character of the series, Sakura, is a high school girl with a crush on Nozaki, but when she incorrectly words her confession, she ends up becoming Nozaki's inker assistant. She is in class 2-A and a member of the school's art club.</p>
