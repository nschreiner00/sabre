    <h2>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h2>
    <p>Skyrim is set 200 years after the events of Oblivion, though it is not a direct sequel. The game takes place in the land of Skyrim, a province of the Empire on the continent of Tamriel, amid a civil war between two factions. The Stormcloaks, led by Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak, are made up of Skyrim's native Nord race. Their goal is an independent Skyrim free from Imperial interference. The Imperial Legion, the military of the Empire, opposes the Stormcloaks and seek to reunite and pacify the province. General Tullius leads the Imperial forces in Skyrim.</p>
    <p>The story begins with the imprisoned player being led to an Imperial execution in the town of Helgen, alongside a thief, several Stormcloak soldiers and their leader, Ulfric Stormcloak. A dragon unexpectedly interrupts the procession, attacking and destroying the town before the player's head is chopped off. The player escapes and journeys to the nearby town of Riverwood, whose residents are now fearful that the dragon could strike their town as well at any moment. Riverwood also serves as a tutorial village in that the player can forge items, trade goods, practice alchemy, and receive miscellaneous quests. The player is asked to make their way to the city of Whiterun, to request aid from the city's Jarl against the dragon threat. Jarl Balgruuf the Greater accepts. He also directs the player to his court wizard, who asks the player to retrieve the Dragonstone, an ancient artifact that shows the location of ancient dragon burial sites. No dragons will be generated until the player returns to Whiterun, with the exception of Helgen, during the beginning of the storyline.</p>
    <p>The player returns to Whiterun with the Dragonstone, only to learn that another dragon has appeared near the city. After slaying the dragon with assistance from the city's guards, the player unexpectedly absorbs the dragon's soul which grants them the ability to perform a magical ability called a &quot;Thu'um&quot;, or Shout. The city's guards are astonished, and inform the player that they must be a Dragonborn, a mortal born with the soul and power of a dragon. After returning to the Jarl with news of the dragon's defeat, the player is summoned to meet with the Greybeards, an order of monks who live in seclusion in their temple of High Hrothgar on the slopes of Skyrim's tallest mountain, the Throat of the World.</p>
    <p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was released to critical acclaim, with reviewers particularly responding well to the refined character development and setting. The game shipped over seven million copies to retailers within the first week of its release, and sold over 20 million copies across all three platforms.</p>
